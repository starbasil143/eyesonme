Your gift is extraordinary.
But it is important that you use it only as I instruct you. For the good of the church.
To use it for anything else would be unforgivable in the eyes of the Morninglord.
It must never be known that you were given this gift.
You must never be seen performing these miracles.
Stay behind the curtain. Perform the miracles from there.
I will take the stage.
